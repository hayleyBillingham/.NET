    <h1>.NET application frameworks and libraries to harness prebuilt functionality</h1>
    <ul><li>
        All software is built in layers, meaning that software runs at various levels of abstraction on a computer:    </li>
    <li>At the lowest level, software communicates directly with your computers hardware.  It controls the flows of data on the motherboard, processors, memory and hard drives.</li>
<li>At the next level, software enables the end user to provide instructions through an operating system.</li>
<li>At the next level, software like .NET provides a way to you to develop and run applications</li>
<li>At the next level, application framrworkds and libraries of functionality allow you to quickly build rice applications by using less effort from older development methods allowed</li></ul>
<li>A code library encapsulates functionality for a specfic purpose into a single assembly.  For .NET thousands fo libraries are available</li>
<li>These libraries can be first part or third party and can be commercial or open source</li>
<li>The libraries provide a vast array of functionality that you can use in yuour applications</li>
<li>You mearly references those asssemblies and call the methods you need</li>
<li>This way you save time and energy because you dont have to build and maintain every feature yourself</li>
<li>A code library encapsulates functionality for a specific purpose into a single assemblt for .NET, thousands of libraries are available</li>
