    <h1>.NET Compiler</h1>
    <ul><li>Software developers use .NET langugaes like C# and F# to write source code.</li>
    <li>Each line of code expresses an instruction or command that the computer should perform while the program is running</li>
<li>Before software developers run their code, the must first compile it</li>
<li>The .NET compiler is a program that converts the source code into a special language called <i>intermediate language</i></li>
<li>The .NET compiler saves the IL code into a file called a .NET assembly</li>
<li>By compilng the code into an 'intermediate' format you can use the same code base regardless of where you run the code</li>
<li>The .NET runtime is an execution enviroment for your compiled .NET assembly.  In other words the .NET runtime is what executes and manages your application as it runs on a host operating system</li>
<li>C# and .NET are distinct.  C# is a programming language syntax.  As part of the synta you can reference and call methods defined in .NET code libraries, or assemblies</li>
</ul>
